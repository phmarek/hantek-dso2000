# Data exchange with Hantek DSO 2000 series

Here is an accumulation of scripts that allow to get data from a Hantek DSO 2D15 (and others of this series, I hope); pushing data (ie. configuration and wave generator waveforms) is also on-topic.

## Current status

CH1 and/or CH2 data get fetched, and written in the JSON along with a bit of metadata (like sampling rate).

### JSON example

```json
